## Re-arranged Inventory of the website

### What is this minor?

#### Introduction
A short introduction about the minor web development. This is mostly focused on "web is cool" aspect but we want people to see more of our projects of what we made. So we really need to show more and tell less.

#### Programme
A quick look of the programme and projects the minor is giving the students. This is currently being viewed on the page under details. The programme should be more _out_ there. Show the CSS hardships and the awesome things made with WAFS.

### What makes this minor so good

#### Impression
A great way to show how great this minor is via pictures. The pictures that are being used now aren't really doing the "promotion" of the minor any good. Yes we have a great "vibe" going on but as a new student. I want to know what did you guys make and what did you learn. So I can see the more informative things.

### What kind of student are you looking for?

#### Is this minor for you?
You want to set the tone for the minor and what kind of student the minor is looking for. This is mostly to "filter" the right students for the minor but also motivate the student who maybe isn't really secure about his choice.

#### Requirements
Required to join the Minor.
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### Where can i join

#### Join?
Who to contact, and when to join the minor!

#### Testimonials
What grades have been given to the minor. Plus a quote to finish it off.
